Incidence Rates in 1970: Based on the model output, the estimated incidence rates in 1970 (per 100,000 person-years) are: 

Males: 26.2

Females: 27.7

Incidence Rates in 2020: Based on the model output, the estimated incidence rates in 2020 (per 100,000 person-years) are:

Males: 48.4

Females: 51.2

Model Assumptions:

Regarding changes over calendar years: The model uses a natural spline function with 4 degrees of freedom. This assumes that the trend of incidence rates over time is non-linear and smooth. It allows the rate to curve (increase or decrease at varying speeds) rather than forcing it to follow a strict straight line, but it assumes there are no sudden, jagged jumps in the rate.

Regarding the difference between males and females: The model includes sex as a main effect. This assumes that the difference between males and females is constant on the log scale (proportional hazards). In other words, it assumes the "shape" of the trend over time is identical for both sexes (parallel curves), and the ratio of female-to-male incidence remains the same throughout the entire period (1970–2020).

```

Conclusions:

Strong Age Effect: The graph clearly shows that incidence rates increase exponentially with age, indicated by the distinct vertical separation of the age-group lines on the log scale. Age is the strongest predictor of risk.

Time Trend: There is a general upward trend in incidence rates from 1970 to 2020 across most adult age groups, indicating a period effect where risk has increased over time.

Sex Difference: Males consistently show slightly higher incidence rates than females of the same age, though the temporal trends (slope of the lines) are similar between sexes.

Non-linearity: The smoothed lines show some curvature, justifying the use of splines rather than a strict linear assumption for the calendar year effect.
